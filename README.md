# sinc_net_proj2

I forked and ran sincnet on my machine and performed the following
1) reproduced the results on a smalle subset of the TIMIT dataset. This took a long time and overheated my computer, even after I decided to only train/test on a small subset of the data. Make sure you update the output filepath on the code.
2) ran the speaker_id.py on my own data. I adjusted the classes to 2, as I only used data with 2 classes.

# sinc_net_proj2

I forked and ran sincnet on my machine and performed the following
1) reproduced the results on a smalle subset of the TIMIT dataset. This took a very long time and overheated my computer, even after I decided to only train/test on a small subset of the data.
2) ran the speaker_id.py on my own data.
